# RFM Analysis
The “RFM” in RFM analysis stands for recency, frequency and monetary value. RFM analysis is a way to use data based on existing customer behavior to predict how a new customer is likely to act in the future. An RFM model is built using three key factors:

how recently a customer has transacted with a brand
how frequently they’ve engaged with a brand
how much money they’ve spent on a brand’s products and services

## Benefits of RFM Analysis
RFM analysis enables marketers to increase revenue by targeting specific groups of existing customers (i.e., customer segmentation) with messages and offers that are more likely to be relevant based on data about a particular set of behaviors. This leads to increased response rates, customer retention, customer satisfaction, and customer lifetime value (CLTV).
Each of these RFM metrics has been shown to be effective in predicting future customer behavior and increasing revenue.

## How Does RFM Analysis Work?
Rather than segmenting customers only using demographic and psychographic data, marketers can create segments based on the real-world behavior of individuals, including purchase history across any channel (online or offline), browsing history, prior campaign responses and more. Unsurprisingly, this type of segmentation is called behavioral segmentation.

Tracking of the three easily quantifiable characteristics that contribute to RFM analysis:

Recency value: This refers to the amount of time since a customer’s last interaction with a brand, which can include their last purchase, a visit to a website, use of a mobile app, a “like” on social media and more. Recency is a key metric because customers who have interacted with your brand more recently are more likely to respond to new marketing efforts.

Frequency value: This refers to the number of times a customer has made a purchase or otherwise interacted with your brand during a particular period of time. Frequency is a key metric because it shows how deeply a customer is engaged with your brand. 

Monetary value: This refers to the total amount a customer has spent purchasing products and services from your brand over a particular period of time. Monetary value is a key metric because the customers who have spent the most in the past are more likely to spend more in the future.

### Steps of RFM Analysis
The steps below provide a high-level overview of how an RFM Analysis and segmentation is executed.

#### Build RFM Model
In order to build an RFM model, you need to assign a recency score, frequency score and monetary score to each unique customer. The raw data, which can be collected from a customer database from previous transactions, is then compiled in a spreadsheet or database.

#### Divide the Customer Segment
Next, divide the RFM database into tiered groups for each of the three values of the RFM score. Tier designation is based on the greatest to the least. For example, tier one for monetary value is assigned to the high spenders and tier five is assigned to the lowest spenders.

#### Select the Targeted Customer Group(s)
The third step involves the selection of the segmented customer group with high customer value. Organizing the RFM segment, you can begin to assign titles to segments of interest, such as your best customers, biggest spenders, faithful customers and at-risk customers.

#### Craft a Personalized Marketing Strategy
Finally, craft a unique marketing strategy designed for each RFM segment focused on their behavioral patterns. Utilizing the RFM Analysis, marketers are able to effectively communicate their messaging to customers in a way aligned with customer behavior.



## RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation
Rather than analyzing the entire customer database, it’s better to segment customers by characteristics like age or geography and separate them into a customer group. By engaging them in a well-segmented marketing campaign, you are able to create a relevant, personalized offer for a high-value customer.

Computing RFM for real-world application typically requires special analytical expertise or advanced math skills. And, like any model, this is done on a scale of 1 to 10. A 10 indicates the top 10% in each category (i.e., the most recent to transact, the most frequent to transact and those who purchased the most), a 9 the next 10% and so forth. By using a RFM scoring system such as this you can construct an effective marketing strategy by creating customer RFM segments, including:

#### Your best customers: 
These are the customers who earn top scores in every category. They’re loyal, willing to spend generously and likely to make another purchase soon. Such customers are primed to respond well to loyalty programs. They’re more likely to be interested in new products you launch. And because they’re committed to your brand and its products, it probably makes less business sense to offer them discount pricing. Instead, increase CLTV by suggesting big-ticket items and recommending products based on past purchases.
#### Your big spenders: 
This customer segment is based on only one of the three metrics: customers with top scores for monetary value. Typically, marketers target this segment with luxury offers, higher subscription tiers and value-add cross-/upsells that increase average order value. Again, it probably makes sense not to shrink margins by offering discounts.
#### Your loyal customers:
This is another customer segment that takes into consideration only one of the three metrics: customers with top scores for frequency. Despite making purchases often, they aren’t necessarily your biggest spenders, so consider rewarding them with free shipping or similar offers. Advocacy programs and reviews can also be effective ways to engage these customers.
#### Your faithful customers: 
Customers who score high for frequency but low in monetary value tend to respond best to product recommendations based on past purchases, as well as incentives tied to spending thresholds (e.g., a free gift for transactions above the brand’s average order value).
#### Your at-risk customers: 
Customers who have been in your top tier in the past (best, big spenders and/or loyal) but who now score low for recency and frequency present a special opportunity. Marketers should consider targeting them with messages aimed at retention, such as discount pricing, exclusive offers and new product launches. With the help of your CDP, you can even create specific customer journeys aimed at re-engaging and retaining at-risk customers.
